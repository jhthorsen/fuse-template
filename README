NAME
    Fuse::Template - Mount a template dir

NOTE
    This project is a work in progress - Nothing works just now.

DESCRIPTION
     root/               -> mountpooit/
     root/somefile       -> mountpoint/somefile
     root/foo.tt         -> mountpoint/foo
     root/bar/baz.txt.tt -> mountpoint/bar/baz.txt

    "somefile" is accessible directly at "mountpoint". Template files (.tt)
    are read and the output is accessible on mountpoint side.

    Files in mountpoint are read-only.

ATTRIBUTES
  root
     $object = $self->root;

    $object must be stringified to path where templates/files are located.
    $object must follow the same API as Fuse::Template::Root.

    Can be set in constructor:

     root => \%constructor_args
     root => $path_to_root

    %constructor_args can override defaults, while $path_to_root will only
    override "path" attribute in root-object.

  mountpoint
     $path = $self->mountpoint;

    Path to where the filesystem should be mounted.

  mountopts
     $str = $self->mountopts;

    Default: "allow_other".

  debug
     $bool = $self->debug;

    Enable/disable debug output from Fuse. Default is disabled.

METHODS
  run
     $exit_code = $self->run;

    Starts Fuse's mainloop.

  find_file
     $real_path = $self->find_file($virtual_path);

    Returns path to the actual template file, from $virtual_path.

  log
     $bool = $self->log($level, $format, @args);
